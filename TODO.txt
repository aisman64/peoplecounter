-> Important
	- Device registration
	- Receive datasets from device
	- User login: Facebook (or Google, Github etc...) tie-in
	- Basic packet statistics (which?)

-> Features
	-> Physical location mapping of devices
	-> People counting
		-> Location density graphs/maps over time
	-> MAC tracking
		-> Per-MAC time tacking, maps, graphs etc.
		-> "What do you know about me?" -> Page shows your current device's MAC's info
	-> Triangulation
		-> 1D mapping constraint in hall-ways for devices of certain signal strength derivatives?

-> Later
	- Device monitoring tables (cpu, mem, network)
	- Use some API to look up SSID physical locations

-> Tables:
	- data
		-> One row = one packet
		-> `sigstr` = signal strength (0 [strong] to -99 [weak]; dbm)
		-> One `ssid` per packet (string)
		-> `dataset` (id)
		-> `device` is a string
			- change `device` to `deviceId`
		-> mac string -> add separate table instead
		-> prefix = `oui` string
			- not needed
		-> file = filename (sent by device in a batch)
			- not needed

	- datasets
		-> Multiple files per dataset

	- ssid
		-> exported from `data`
		-> Sometimes they send binary data?

	- devices


	[unimportant for now]
	- oui
		- (I guess, you imported this from some website?)
	- clean
		-> Get rid of it
	- files
	- ifaces
	- cpu
	- mem
